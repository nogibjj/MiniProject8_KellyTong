## IDS 706 MiniProject8: Rewrite a Python Script in Rust
This is a repository for IDS 706 mini project week 8 assignment.

### Purpose
This repository compares the running time and efficiency of python and rust. 
This is done by performing the same data processing with python script and rust.
In this case, the average of the chosen columns/variables are calculated. 
Improvement in running time, speed, and resource usage can be analyzed and
evluated through the repository action.
